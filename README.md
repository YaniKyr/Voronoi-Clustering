# Voronoi-Clustering A simple Approach
 
Data: You can input a 2d(x,y) or 3d(x,y,z) data only. The parsing might need some changes, "it is on user's hand".

Algorithm: The Clustering is made with K-means and the bounding of the clusters with Jarvi's March algorithm. Then the created graph, is saved in DCEL data structure(Doubly Connected Edge List).

Note: This repo does not contain Fortune's Algorithm. It is observation based solution.
